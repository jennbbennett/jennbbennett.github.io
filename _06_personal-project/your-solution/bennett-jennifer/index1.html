					Hi, I'm Jennifer Bennett.<br>
					<br>
					I'm a native Virginian and East Coast girl, who was happily transplanted to the West almost six years ago.  I've moved a lot, attending high school in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, college in Virginia (University of Richmond), graduate school in Ohio (Miami University), and law school in Washington, D.C. (Georgetown).  <br>
					<br>
					I love my Colorado life in Castle Rock with my husband of 20+ years, Robert, and our three children: Hailey (senior), Carter (freshman), and Quinlan (7th grade).<br>
